## What is BetterDisplay Pro?  

**BetterDisplay Pro** is an advanced **display management and calibration tool** built for professionals who need total control over every visual detail of their screens. It enhances the macOS display system by enabling precise adjustments for resolution, brightness, refresh rate, and scaling across multiple monitors.  

This app goes far beyond the native system controls. With BetterDisplay Pro, users can **activate hidden resolutions**, **emulate Retina scaling**, and **build custom profiles** for their displays. The result is a sharper, more optimized workspace — whether for design, editing, coding, or high-resolution content review.  

The built-in **Dummy Display function** allows users to simulate additional monitors, perfect for testing setups, streaming, or remote work environments. BetterDisplay Pro also supports color management, hardware calibration, and per-display configuration for complete visual accuracy.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon** and modern macOS versions, it delivers fast responsiveness and low system resource usage. For anyone working with multiple displays or requiring pixel-level precision, BetterDisplay Pro provides the flexibility and depth that creative professionals need.
